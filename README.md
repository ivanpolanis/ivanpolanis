# Hi there! I'm Iván

I'm a passionate developer from La Plata, Argentina. I'm currently studying Computer Engineering at the National University of La Plata, where I'm learning everything I need to become a top-notch software engineer.

In addition to my university studies, I always like to stay up-to-date on the latest technologies and development tools, although I haven't yet delved into all of them. So far, I have experience in JavaScript and React, and I'm learning TypeScript to improve my development skills.

I believe that working in a team is the best way to learn and improve as a developer. I always strive to write clean code and follow best programming practices. I'm interested in working on projects that involve innovative technologies and have a positive impact on people's lives.
